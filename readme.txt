Hello user! Hope your day is going well!

Now you may be wondering, why would this project made by amateurs, be of any practical use? But when you look into it, this little “game of ours'' was meant to educate the masses on wilderness survival. The number of hikers that die each year in the US alone is shocking, around 2,348 in 2013. Current rates are unknown. So to think so many people die of such trivial matters concerns us. We made this to play our part to reduce forest related death. Thereby the purpose of our game, Wilderness Survival.


This game, for its quality, seems to require minimal resources. But Pygame is an inefficient module. Therefore the minimum requirements to play this game include: 


* Operating system: 64-bit Windows 7 and above or OS X 10.11 or higher or Linux 
* Processor: 1.5GHz 
* Memory: 4GB+ RAM
* Free HDD space: 3GB 
* Keyboard and Mouse
* Monitor:
   * Minimum: 1366x768
   * Recommended: 1920x1080



Required Dependencies: 
* Python 3
* Pygame (pip instal pygame)
* ffpyplayer (pip install ffpyplayer)
* cv2 (pip install opencv-python)
* Python IDE


How to use it:
While designing, we kept simplicity and usability at top. In turn, this game should be incredibly easy to use. After running the game, you will be booted into a screen with 5 options.
* Animation: Hit this to play a fun little game to boost memory
* Results: How well you did on the quiz
* Quiz: To see how much you’ve learned from the lesson
* Lesson: A quick tutorial on how to survive the wilderness
* Quit: If you don’t like devs, you’d hit this button (Meant to exit the game and end the program)


Recommended order:
* Lesson
* Play
* Quiz
* results
* Quit


Troubleshooting:
If your game doesn’t boot up, or greets you with an error message in the console. Then we recommend you check the file paths, and see if they fit your computer’s. See if you have all the files downloaded. And also have all your dependencies, our program relies on it to generate the interactive videos and backgrounds.
